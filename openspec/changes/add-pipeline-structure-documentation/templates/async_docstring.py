# Example async function docstring structure:

"""[One-line imperative summary: 'Process embeddings asynchronously'].

[Detailed explanation including:
 - What the async function does step-by-step
 - Why it's async (I/O operations, external API calls, etc.)
 - Concurrency characteristics
 - Error handling strategy]

Args:
    param_name: [Describe purpose, valid values, constraints]
        [Additional lines for complex parameters]
    **kwargs: [Describe what keyword arguments are accepted]

Returns:
    [Describe return value structure and meaning]
    [For async functions, describe what the coroutine yields]

Raises:
    ExceptionType: [When and why this exception is raised]
        [Include conditions that trigger it]
    AnotherException: [When this occurs]

Note:
    [Any important implementation notes]
    [Concurrency: "Runs concurrently with other async operations"]
    [I/O operations: "Makes external API calls, database queries"]
    [Thread safety: "Safe to call from multiple async tasks"]
    [Side effects: "Emits 'embedding.started' metric"]

Warning:
    [Any gotchas or surprising behavior users should know about]
    [Example: "May timeout if external service is slow"]

Example:

# Real example for async embedding persistence:

) -> None:
    """Persist embedding vectors to storage backend asynchronously.

    Persists a batch of embedding vectors to the configured storage backend
    with proper tenant isolation and metadata storage. This operation is
    async to handle I/O-bound storage operations efficiently.

    This method performs the following steps:
    1. Validate persistence context and tenant permissions
    2. Prepare vectors for storage with proper formatting
    3. Store vectors in batches to optimize performance
    4. Store associated metadata separately for efficient querying
    5. Update persistence metrics and telemetry

    Args:
        context: PersistenceContext containing tenant_id, namespace,
            and other context information. Must have valid tenant_id.
        vectors: List of EmbeddingVector objects to persist. Each vector
            must have valid embedding data and associated metadata.
        metadata: Additional metadata to store with the vectors including
            model information, creation timestamp, and any custom fields.

    Returns:
        None: This is a fire-and-forget operation. Success is indicated
            by lack of exceptions. Use telemetry to monitor completion.

    Raises:
        PersistenceError: If storage backend is unavailable or returns
            an error. Includes details about the specific failure.
        ValidationError: If vectors or metadata fail validation checks.
            Includes specific validation failure details.
        PermissionError: If tenant does not have permission to persist
            to the specified namespace.

    Note:
        Concurrency: Safe to call from multiple async tasks concurrently
        I/O operations: Makes network calls to storage backend
        Thread safety: Not thread-safe due to shared storage client
        Side effects: Emits 'embedding.persisted' metric with batch size
        Performance: O(n) time complexity where n is vector count
        Memory: O(1) space complexity (processes vectors in batches)

    Warning:
        May timeout if storage backend is slow or unresponsive.
        Large batches may be split into smaller chunks automatically.

    Example:
        >>> context = PersistenceContext(
        ...     tenant_id="tenant1",
        ...     namespace="medical",
        ...     model_name="biobert"

# Real example for async embedding generation:

    """Generate embeddings for text inputs asynchronously.

    Generates embedding vectors for a list of text inputs using the
    specified model and namespace. This operation is async to handle
    potentially long-running embedding generation efficiently.

    This method performs the following steps:
    1. Validate model availability and namespace permissions
    2. Preprocess texts for embedding generation
    3. Generate embeddings in batches for efficiency
    4. Post-process embeddings and add metadata
    5. Return formatted EmbeddingVector objects

    Args:
        texts: List of text strings to embed. Each text must be
            non-empty and within token limits for the model.
        model_name: Name of the embedding model to use. Must be
            available in the embedding model registry.
        namespace: Namespace for embedding generation. Must be
            accessible by the current tenant.

    Returns:
        list[EmbeddingVector]: List of embedding vectors corresponding
            to input texts. Each vector contains embedding data and
            metadata including model information and text length.

    Raises:
        ModelNotFoundError: If the specified model is not available
            in the embedding model registry.
        NamespaceAccessError: If the tenant does not have permission
            to use the specified namespace.
        EmbeddingGenerationError: If embedding generation fails due
            to model errors or resource constraints.

    Note:
        Concurrency: Safe to call from multiple async tasks concurrently
        I/O operations: Makes calls to embedding service (potentially GPU-bound)
        Thread safety: Not thread-safe due to shared model resources
        Side effects: Emits 'embedding.generated' metric with batch size
        Performance: O(n) time complexity where n is text count
        Memory: O(n) space complexity for storing embeddings

    Warning:
        May timeout if embedding service is slow or GPU is unavailable.
        Large text inputs may be truncated to fit model token limits.
