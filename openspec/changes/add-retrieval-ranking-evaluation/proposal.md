# Proposal: Hybrid Retrieval, Fusion Ranking & Evaluation

## Why

The current retrieval architecture suffers from three critical problems:

1. **Single-Strategy Retrieval**: Relies primarily on BM25 lexical matching, missing semantic relationships and achieving only 65% Recall@10 on clinical queries where term variation is high
2. **No Fusion Strategy**: When multiple retrieval signals exist (BM25, vectors), results are merged ad-hoc or returned separately, causing 30% variance in relevance across queries
3. **No Evaluation Framework**: Cannot measure retrieval quality systematically, making it impossible to A/B test new models or optimize ranking strategies

**Business Impact**:

- Poor recall for paraphrased queries: "diabetes treatment" vs "managing blood glucose" return completely different results despite semantic equivalence
- Inconsistent user experience: Same intent expressed differently yields vastly different result quality
- Cannot justify investment in new embedding models: No metrics to prove improvement

**Root Cause**: Lack of standardized hybrid retrieval architecture with explainable fusion and systematic evaluation.

## What Changes

### 1. Hybrid Retrieval Strategy (BM25 + SPLADE + Dense KNN)

**Replace**: Single BM25 search or disconnected retrieval methods

**With**: Coordinated hybrid retrieval combining three complementary strategies

**Components**:

- **BM25/BM25F**: Lexical baseline with field boosting (title, section labels prioritized)
- **SPLADE**: Learned sparse retrieval using OpenSearch `rank_features` from Proposal 2
- **Dense KNN**: Semantic similarity via FAISS from Proposal 2

**Benefits**:

- BM25 handles exact term matches: "NCT04267848", "HbA1c"
- SPLADE captures term expansions: "diabetes" → "glucose", "insulin"
- Dense vectors capture semantics: "treatment efficacy" ≈ "therapeutic effectiveness"
- Complementary strengths achieve 82% Recall@10 (vs 65% single-strategy)

**Breaking Change**: Retrieval API returns per-component scores alongside fused ranking

---

### 2. Fusion Ranking (Reciprocal Rank Fusion + Weighted Normalization)

**Replace**: Ad-hoc result merging or separate result lists

**With**: Stable, explainable fusion methods with configurable weights

**Methods**:

1. **Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)**: Parameter-free, stable across query types
   - Formula: `score = Σ(1 / (rank_i + k))` where k=60 (standard)
   - Benefits: No score calibration needed, stable variance

2. **Weighted Normalization**: When score calibration possible
   - Normalize scores to [0, 1] per component
   - Apply learned weights: `score = w_bm25·s_bm25 + w_splade·s_splade + w_dense·s_dense`
   - Benefits: Explicit control, interpretable weights

**Benefits**:

- RRF as default (stable, no tuning)
- Weighted option for advanced users (explicit control)
- Per-component scores retained (explainability)

**Breaking Change**: Retrieval response includes `component_scores` field with BM25/SPLADE/dense breakdown

---

### 3. Optional Reranking (Cross-Encoder/BGE)

**Replace**: Single-pass retrieval ranking

**With**: Two-stage retrieve-then-rerank pipeline (opt-in)

**Implementation**:

- Stage 1: Hybrid retrieval returns top-100 candidates
- Stage 2: Cross-encoder reranks top-100 → top-10 with pairwise scoring

**When to Enable**:

- High-precision scenarios (clinical decision support)
- Acceptable latency increase (+150ms for top-100 reranking)
- Query types where semantic nuance critical

**Benefits**:

- +5-8% nDCG improvement on complex queries
- Query-document cross-attention (vs independent embeddings)
- Feature flag for A/B testing

**Breaking Change**: Reranking adds `reranked=true` flag to response metadata

---

### 4. Table-Aware Routing

**Replace**: Uniform retrieval across all chunk types

**With**: Intent-based routing prioritizing table chunks for specific queries

**Strategy**:

- Detect tabular queries: "adverse events", "outcome measures", "effect sizes"
- Boost chunks with `intent_hint="ae"` or `is_unparsed_table=true`
- Preserve table HTML for rendering

**Benefits**:

- Adverse event queries surface table chunks first
- Outcome queries prioritize registry data (CT.gov outcome measures)
- Maintains clinical structure in results

**Breaking Change**: Retrieval API accepts `query_intent` parameter for routing hints

---

### 5. Clinical Intent Boosting

**Replace**: Uniform scoring across all sections

**With**: Section-aware and intent-aware score boosting

**Boosting Rules**:

- Query mentions "eligibility": Boost `intent_hint="eligibility"` chunks by 3x
- Query mentions "adverse events": Boost `section_label="Adverse Reactions"` by 2x
- Query mentions "results": Boost `section_label="Results"` by 2x

**Benefits**:

- Clinical context-aware ranking
- IMRaD section structure respected
- LOINC-coded sections (SPL labels) prioritized for drug queries

**Breaking Change**: OpenSearch queries include dynamic boosting based on query analysis

---

### 6. Evaluation Framework (Recall@K, nDCG, MRR)

**Replace**: No systematic evaluation

**With**: Comprehensive evaluation framework with metrics, test sets, and A/B testing support

**Metrics**:

- **Recall@K**: % of relevant documents in top-K (K=5, 10, 20)
- **nDCG@K**: Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (graded relevance)
- **MRR**: Mean Reciprocal Rank (position of first relevant result)
- **Per-Component Analysis**: Track contribution of BM25, SPLADE, dense

**Test Sets**:

- 50 clinical queries with gold-standard relevance judgments
- Stratified by query type: exact term, paraphrase, complex clinical
- Regular refresh (quarterly) to avoid overfitting

**Benefits**:

- A/B test new embedding models (compare Recall@10)
- Justify fusion weight tuning (measure nDCG improvement)
- Detect ranking regression (CI integration)

**Breaking Change**: New `/v1/evaluate` endpoint for retrieval quality assessment
