# Codebase Reduction Report â€“ Dagster Migration

| Scope | Files | Blank | Comment | Code |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ------- | ---- |
| Baseline (`cloc` before removal) | 13 | 257 | 45 | 1822 |
| Current (`cloc` after removal) | 12 | 229 | 44 | 1458 |

- **Lines removed:** 364 (-19.97%) across the embedding and retrieval service
  packages.
- **Files removed:** 1 Python module (`indexing_service.py`) plus four legacy
  test suites covering the deleted worker/indexer implementations.

Commands executed:

```bash
cloc src/Medical_KG_rev/services/embedding src/Medical_KG_rev/services/retrieval
```

The reduction reflects the deletion of bespoke embedding and indexing services
in favour of Dagster stage execution and Haystack components.
