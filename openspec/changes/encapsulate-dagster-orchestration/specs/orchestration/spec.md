## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Encapsulated Dagster Orchestration Interface
The system SHALL provide a dedicated `DagsterIngestionClient` that encapsulates Dagster orchestration logic, pipeline resolution, and job metadata flows behind a clean interface.

#### Scenario: Clean Orchestration Interface
- **GIVEN** the `DagsterIngestionClient` interface
- **WHEN** submitting ingestion jobs for processing
- **THEN** it SHALL expose a simple `submit(dataset, request, item) -> DagsterSubmissionResult` method
- **AND** hide pipeline resolution, domain mapping, and telemetry concerns
- **AND** return typed results indicating success, duplicate, or failure outcomes
- **AND** provide clear error information for troubleshooting

#### Scenario: Pipeline Resolution Encapsulation
- **GIVEN** pipeline selection and configuration logic
- **WHEN** determining appropriate pipeline for a dataset
- **THEN** the client SHALL handle topology selection and validation internally
- **AND** support fallback strategies for missing or incompatible pipelines
- **AND** cache pipeline configurations for performance
- **AND** provide pipeline compatibility checking and version management

#### Scenario: Domain Resolution Encapsulation
- **GIVEN** adapter domain mapping and configuration
- **WHEN** resolving appropriate adapter for ingestion requests
- **THEN** the client SHALL handle adapter discovery and capability matching
- **AND** validate domain compatibility and configuration requirements
- **AND** support domain-specific normalization and transformation
- **AND** provide clear error messages for domain resolution failures

### Requirement: Typed Orchestration Results
The orchestration system SHALL return strongly-typed results that clearly indicate job outcomes, metadata, and error conditions for consistent handling across the gateway layer.

#### Scenario: Structured Result Types
- **GIVEN** different possible outcomes of job submission
- **WHEN** processing ingestion requests
- **THEN** the client SHALL return specific result types (`SubmissionSuccess`, `SubmissionDuplicate`, `SubmissionFailure`)
- **AND** each result type SHALL contain relevant metadata (job_id, timing, progress)
- **AND** failure results SHALL include contextual error information
- **AND** results SHALL be serializable for logging and debugging

#### Scenario: Result Metadata Enrichment
- **GIVEN** orchestration result objects
- **WHEN** jobs progress through their lifecycle
- **THEN** results SHALL include job correlation information and timing data
- **AND** provide progress tracking and intermediate status updates
- **AND** maintain audit trails for regulatory compliance
- **AND** support result comparison and analysis for performance monitoring

#### Scenario: Error Context Preservation
- **GIVEN** orchestration failures and error conditions
- **WHEN** errors occur during job submission or execution
- **THEN** error results SHALL preserve contextual information for debugging
- **AND** include stack traces and error correlation data
- **AND** provide actionable error messages for resolution
- **AND** support error categorization for different failure modes

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Orchestration Job Management
The orchestration system SHALL encapsulate Dagster integration behind a clean client interface that separates orchestration concerns from gateway business logic.

#### Scenario: Separation of Orchestration Concerns
- **WHEN** the gateway needs to submit orchestration jobs
- **THEN** it SHALL use the `DagsterIngestionClient` interface
- **AND** focus on result transformation and API response formatting
- **AND** not need intimate knowledge of Dagster pipeline topologies
- **AND** delegate pipeline resolution and domain mapping to the client

#### Scenario: Error Handling Integration
- **GIVEN** encapsulated orchestration error handling
- **WHEN** Dagster-specific errors occur
- **THEN** the client SHALL translate them to gateway-appropriate error types
- **AND** preserve error context for debugging and monitoring
- **AND** provide recovery strategies and retry mechanisms
- **AND** maintain error correlation across orchestration boundaries

#### Scenario: Performance and Monitoring Integration
- **GIVEN** orchestration performance monitoring
- **WHEN** jobs execute through the orchestration pipeline
- **THEN** the client SHALL collect and report performance metrics
- **AND** support distributed tracing for orchestration flows
- **AND** provide performance profiling and optimization capabilities
- **AND** enable alerting based on orchestration-specific thresholds
