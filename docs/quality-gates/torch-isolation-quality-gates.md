# Torch Isolation Quality Gates

This document describes the quality gates implemented to ensure the torch isolation architecture is maintained and properly validated.

## Overview

The torch isolation quality gates are automated checks that validate:

1. **No torch imports** in the main gateway code
2. **No torch usage** in the main gateway code
3. **gRPC clients exist** for all torch functionality
4. **Proto definitions exist** for all services
5. **Docker configurations** are properly set up
6. **Requirements.txt is torch-free**
7. **Service integration** is properly configured
8. **Performance requirements** are met
9. **Security standards** are maintained

## Quality Gate Components

### 1. CI Torch Isolation Check (`scripts/ci_torch_isolation_check.py`)

**Purpose**: Prevents torch imports from being added to the main gateway.

**Checks**:

- Scans main gateway code for torch imports
- Scans main gateway code for torch usage
- Validates gRPC clients exist
- Validates proto definitions exist
- Validates Docker configurations exist
- Validates requirements.txt is torch-free

**Integration**: Runs in the `lint` job of the CI pipeline.

**Failure Action**: Blocks the CI pipeline if any torch dependencies are found.

### 2. Torch-Free Deployment Validation (`scripts/validate_torch_free_deployment.py`)

**Purpose**: Validates that deployments are torch-free and properly configured.

**Checks**:

- Docker images are properly configured for torch isolation
- Production deployment configuration is correct
- Service integration is properly set up
- CI/CD pipeline includes torch isolation validation
- Monitoring configuration exists and is properly configured

**Integration**: Runs in the `service-integration-tests` job of the CI pipeline.

**Failure Action**: Blocks deployment if validation fails.

### 3. Performance Regression Tests (`scripts/performance_regression_test.py`)

**Purpose**: Ensures the service architecture meets performance requirements.

**Checks**:

- GPU service response time ≤ 2.0 seconds
- Embedding service response time ≤ 5.0 seconds
- Reranking service response time ≤ 3.0 seconds
- Docling VLM service response time ≤ 10.0 seconds
- Gateway response time ≤ 1.0 second
- Service discovery time ≤ 0.5 seconds
- Circuit breaker trip time ≤ 1.0 second
- Memory usage ≤ 80%
- CPU usage ≤ 70%
- Concurrent request handling efficiency ≥ 2x
- Load balancing deviation ≤ 10ms

**Integration**: Runs in the `service-integration-tests` job of the CI pipeline.

**Failure Action**: Blocks deployment if performance requirements are not met.

### 4. Security Validation (`scripts/security_validation.py`)

**Purpose**: Validates that the service architecture maintains security standards.

**Checks**:

- mTLS configuration is properly set up
- TLS configuration uses TLSv1.3+
- Service authentication is implemented
- Audit logging is configured
- Data encryption is properly implemented
- Access control is configured
- Rate limiting is implemented
- Input validation is in place
- Error handling is secure

**Integration**: Runs in the `service-integration-tests` job of the CI pipeline.

**Failure Action**: Blocks deployment if security standards are not met.

## CI Pipeline Integration

The quality gates are integrated into the CI pipeline as follows:

```yaml
jobs:
  lint:
    name: Lint & Static Analysis
    steps:
      - name: Torch Isolation Quality Gate
        run: python scripts/ci_torch_isolation_check.py

  service-integration-tests:
    name: Service Integration Tests
    steps:
      - name: Torch-Free Deployment Validation
        run: python scripts/validate_torch_free_deployment.py
      - name: Performance Regression Tests
        run: python scripts/performance_regression_test.py
      - name: Security Validation
        run: python scripts/security_validation.py
```

## Branch Protection Rules

The following status checks are required for the `main` branch:

- Lint & Static Analysis
- Unit Tests
- Docling Validation
- Integration Tests
- Contract Validation
- Service Integration Tests
- **Torch Isolation Quality Gate**
- **Torch-Free Deployment Validation**
- **Performance Regression Tests**
- **Security Validation**

## Quality Gate Failure Handling

### 1. Torch Import Detection

**When**: Torch imports are detected in main gateway code.

**Action**:

1. CI pipeline fails immediately
2. Error message shows exact location of torch imports
3. Developer must remove torch imports before proceeding
4. All torch functionality must be moved to gRPC services

### 2. Performance Regression

**When**: Performance requirements are not met.

**Action**:

1. CI pipeline fails with performance metrics
2. Developer must optimize performance before proceeding
3. Performance thresholds may be adjusted if justified
4. Load testing may be required for validation

### 3. Security Validation Failure

**When**: Security standards are not met.

**Action**:

1. CI pipeline fails with security issues
2. Developer must address security issues before proceeding
3. Security review may be required
4. Compliance validation may be needed

### 4. Deployment Validation Failure

**When**: Deployment configuration is incorrect.

**Action**:

1. CI pipeline fails with deployment issues
2. Developer must fix deployment configuration
3. Infrastructure review may be required
4. Deployment automation may need updates

## Quality Gate Configuration

### Performance Thresholds

```python
performance_thresholds = {
    "gpu_service_response_time": 2.0,  # seconds
    "embedding_service_response_time": 5.0,  # seconds
    "reranking_service_response_time": 3.0,  # seconds
    "docling_vlm_service_response_time": 10.0,  # seconds
    "gateway_response_time": 1.0,  # seconds
    "service_discovery_time": 0.5,  # seconds
    "circuit_breaker_trip_time": 1.0,  # seconds
    "memory_usage_threshold": 80.0,  # percentage
    "cpu_usage_threshold": 70.0,  # percentage
}
```

### Security Requirements

```python
security_requirements = {
    "mTLS_enabled": True,
    "TLS_version": "TLSv1.3",
    "certificate_validation": True,
    "service_authentication": True,
    "audit_logging": True,
    "data_encryption": True,
    "access_control": True,
    "rate_limiting": True,
    "input_validation": True,
    "error_handling": True
}
```

## Monitoring and Alerting

Quality gate failures are monitored and alerted through:

1. **GitHub Actions**: Immediate notification on CI failure
2. **Slack Integration**: Team notifications for quality gate failures
3. **Email Alerts**: Critical quality gate failures
4. **Dashboard Monitoring**: Quality gate success/failure rates

## Quality Gate Maintenance

### Regular Updates

1. **Performance Thresholds**: Updated based on system capacity and requirements
2. **Security Requirements**: Updated based on security standards and compliance
3. **Validation Logic**: Updated based on architecture changes
4. **Integration Points**: Updated based on CI/CD pipeline changes

### Troubleshooting

1. **False Positives**: Investigate and fix validation logic
2. **Performance Issues**: Optimize system performance or adjust thresholds
3. **Security Issues**: Address security vulnerabilities
4. **Configuration Issues**: Fix deployment and service configurations

## Best Practices

1. **Run Quality Gates Locally**: Use scripts before pushing code
2. **Monitor Performance**: Track performance metrics continuously
3. **Security Reviews**: Regular security assessments
4. **Documentation Updates**: Keep quality gate documentation current
5. **Team Training**: Ensure team understands quality gate requirements

## Conclusion

The torch isolation quality gates ensure that:

- The torch isolation architecture is maintained
- Performance requirements are met
- Security standards are upheld
- Deployments are properly configured
- Service integration is validated

These quality gates provide confidence that the torch isolation architecture is working correctly and meets all requirements for production deployment.
