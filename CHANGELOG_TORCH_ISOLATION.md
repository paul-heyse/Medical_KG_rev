# Torch Isolation Architecture Changelog

## Overview

This changelog documents the implementation of the torch isolation architecture, which moves all PyTorch dependencies from the main API gateway to dedicated gRPC services running in Docker containers.

## Changes Made

### 1. Torch Dependency Removal (Task 15.1)

- **Removed torch imports** from all main gateway files
- **Replaced torch functionality** with gRPC service calls
- **Updated GPU management** to use `GpuServiceManager` instead of direct torch calls
- **Modified metrics** to use gRPC service metrics instead of torch-dependent metrics
- **Updated vector store** to use gRPC embedding services

### 2. Documentation Updates (Task 15.2)

- **Updated README.md** to reflect torch-free architecture
- **Created torch-free architecture documentation** (`docs/architecture/torch-free-architecture.md`)
- **Updated architecture diagrams** to show gRPC service communication
- **Modified service descriptions** to emphasize torch isolation

### 3. Code Archiving (Task 15.3)

- **Created archive directory** (`archive/torch-dependent-code/`)
- **Archived original torch-dependent code** with `_original` suffix
- **Created migration notes** and restoration instructions
- **Generated archive manifest** documenting all changes

### 4. Requirements Updates (Task 15.4)

- **Replaced requirements.txt** with torch-free version
- **Updated requirements.in** to exclude torch packages
- **Created requirements-torch-free.txt** and **requirements-torch-free.in**
- **Verified no torch dependencies** in main codebase

## Architecture Changes

### Before (Torch-Dependent)

```
Main Gateway (with torch)
├── Direct GPU operations
├── Embedding generation
├── Model inference
└── Vector operations
```

### After (Torch-Free)

```
Main Gateway (torch-free)
├── gRPC Client Manager
├── Circuit Breaker Pattern
├── Service Discovery
└── Error Handling

GPU Services (torch-enabled)
├── Docling VLM Service
├── Embedding Service
├── Reranking Service
└── GPU Management Service
```

## Benefits Achieved

### 1. Independent Scaling

- GPU services can scale based on AI workload demands
- Main gateway scales based on API request volume
- No resource contention between API and AI operations

### 2. Resource Isolation

- GPU memory and compute resources isolated to containers
- Main gateway uses minimal resources without GPU dependencies
- Clear separation of concerns

### 3. Simplified Deployment

- Main gateway deployable on any infrastructure
- GPU services deployable on specialized GPU nodes
- Easier CI/CD pipelines without GPU dependencies

### 4. Fail-Fast Behavior

- GPU service failures don't crash main gateway
- Circuit breaker patterns prevent cascading failures
- Graceful degradation when GPU services unavailable

## Verification

### Torch Dependency Check

```bash
python scripts/remove_torch_dependencies.py check
# Result: ✅ No torch dependencies found in main codebase
```

### Requirements Verification

```bash
grep -i torch requirements.txt
# Result: No torch packages found
```

### Archive Verification

```bash
ls archive/torch-dependent-code/
# Result: All original torch-dependent code archived
```

## Rollback Plan

If rollback is needed:

1. **Restore archived code**:

   ```bash
   cp archive/torch-dependent-code/gpu_manager_original.py src/Medical_KG_rev/services/gpu/manager.py
   cp archive/torch-dependent-code/metrics_original.py src/Medical_KG_rev/observability/metrics.py
   # ... restore other files as needed
   ```

2. **Restore requirements**:

   ```bash
   cp archive/torch-dependent-code/requirements_original.txt requirements.txt
   cp archive/torch-dependent-code/requirements_original.in requirements.in
   ```

3. **Reinstall dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Test functionality**:

   ```bash
   python -m pytest tests/
   ```

## Future Work

### Remaining Tasks

- [ ] 16.1 Create comprehensive validation tests
- [ ] 16.2 Implement quality gates for torch isolation
- [ ] 16.3 Create acceptance tests for torch isolation
- [ ] 16.4 Implement monitoring validation

### Planned Enhancements

- GPU service auto-scaling based on queue depth
- Advanced caching strategies for repeated operations
- Model warm-up procedures for consistent performance
- Request queuing for high-load scenarios

## Conclusion

The torch isolation architecture has been successfully implemented, providing a robust, scalable foundation for the Medical_KG_rev system. The main gateway is now completely torch-free, with all GPU operations moved to dedicated gRPC services. This enables better resource utilization, improved reliability, and simplified deployment while maintaining high performance for AI workloads.
