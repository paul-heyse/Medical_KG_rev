## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Typed Pipeline State Management

The orchestration runtime SHALL use a strongly-typed state object to manage pipeline execution state instead of untyped dictionaries.

#### Scenario: State Object Creation and Initialization

- **WHEN** a pipeline execution begins
- **THEN** the runtime SHALL create a PipelineState instance with typed fields
- **AND** initialize it with bootstrap context, adapter requests, and empty stage results
- **AND** provide type-safe accessors for all state components

#### Scenario: Type-Safe State Access

- **GIVEN** a PipelineState instance during stage execution
- **WHEN** accessing stage outputs or intermediate results
- **THEN** the system SHALL provide typed accessor methods
- **AND** eliminate the need for defensive casting
- **AND** provide clear error messages for missing or incorrect state

#### Scenario: State Validation and Consistency

- **WHEN** state transitions occur between stages
- **THEN** the system SHALL validate state consistency
- **AND** ensure required fields are present for dependent stages
- **AND** provide helper methods to check stage completion status
- **AND** maintain state integrity across pipeline execution

### Requirement: PipelineState Dataclass Design

The PipelineState SHALL be a dataclass with explicit fields for all pipeline artifacts and helper methods for common operations.

#### Scenario: State Field Definitions

- **GIVEN** the PipelineState dataclass definition
- **THEN** it SHALL have explicit fields for payloads, documents, chunks, embeddings, entities, claims, and metadata
- **AND** use appropriate type annotations including Optional types for conditional stages
- **AND** provide default values for empty/None states

#### Scenario: Helper Methods for State Operations

- **WHEN** working with PipelineState instances
- **THEN** helper methods SHALL be available for common operations like checking stage completion
- **AND** type-safe accessors for retrieving specific stage outputs
- **AND** validation methods for ensuring state consistency
- **AND** serialization methods for logging and debugging

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: State Management in Pipeline Execution

The pipeline runtime SHALL use typed state objects throughout execution instead of untyped dictionary manipulation.

#### Scenario: State Transitions Between Stages

- **WHEN** a stage completes execution
- **THEN** the runtime SHALL update the PipelineState with typed stage outputs
- **AND** validate that the state transition is valid for the stage type
- **AND** maintain type safety throughout the transition process
- **AND** provide clear logging of state changes

#### Scenario: State Access During Stage Execution

- **GIVEN** a stage implementation using PipelineState
- **WHEN** the stage needs to access upstream results
- **THEN** it SHALL use type-safe accessor methods
- **AND** receive clear errors for missing required inputs
- **AND** work with Optional types for conditional dependencies
- **AND** maintain type safety when producing outputs
