## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Domain-Specific Metric Registries

The observability system SHALL provide separate metric registries for each operational domain to improve monitoring clarity and reduce label cardinality.

#### Scenario: GPU Hardware Metrics Registry

- **WHEN** GPU hardware reports operational metrics
- **THEN** metrics SHALL be collected in a dedicated GPU registry with labels for device ID, device name, and hardware status
- **AND** SHALL only include hardware metrics (memory, utilization, temperature)
- **AND** SHALL NOT include service communication metrics

#### Scenario: Internal gRPC Communication Registry

- **WHEN** internal services communicate via gRPC
- **THEN** RPC call metrics SHALL be collected in a dedicated gRPC registry with service, method, and status labels
- **AND** SHALL include all Docker container-to-container communication
- **AND** SHALL NOT include external HTTP traffic

#### Scenario: External API Traffic Registry

- **WHEN** external clients make HTTP requests to API gateway OR adapters call external HTTP APIs
- **THEN** request metrics SHALL be collected in a dedicated External API registry with protocol, endpoint, and method labels
- **AND** SHALL include REST, GraphQL, SOAP, OData client traffic
- **AND** SHALL include adapter outbound HTTP calls to external services
- **AND** SHALL NOT include internal gRPC communication

#### Scenario: Pipeline State Metrics Registry

- **WHEN** orchestration pipeline executes stages
- **THEN** pipeline metrics SHALL be collected in a dedicated pipeline registry with stage and state labels
- **AND** SHALL NOT include communication or hardware metrics

#### Scenario: Cache Performance Metrics Registry

- **WHEN** caching layer processes requests
- **THEN** cache metrics SHALL be collected in a dedicated cache registry with cache operation labels
- **AND** SHALL NOT include communication or hardware metrics

#### Scenario: Reranking Operations Registry

- **WHEN** search reranking operations are performed
- **THEN** reranking metrics SHALL be collected in a dedicated reranking registry with model and operation labels
- **AND** SHALL NOT include communication or hardware metrics

### Requirement: gRPC-First Internal Architecture

All internal service-to-service communication SHALL use gRPC. HTTP SHALL only be used for external client-facing APIs and external database connections.

#### Scenario: Internal Service Communication Protocol

- **WHEN** one internal service needs to communicate with another internal service
- **THEN** it SHALL use gRPC with defined proto contracts
- **AND** SHALL NOT use HTTP for internal communication
- **AND** SHALL collect metrics in gRPC registry

#### Scenario: External API Protocol Selection

- **WHEN** external clients access the API gateway
- **THEN** they MAY use HTTP protocols (REST, GraphQL, SOAP, OData)
- **AND** metrics SHALL be collected in External API registry
- **AND** internal service calls triggered by these requests SHALL use gRPC

#### Scenario: External Database Communication

- **WHEN** services connect to external databases (Neo4j, Qdrant, etc.)
- **THEN** they MAY use database-provided protocols (including HTTP if required)
- **AND** metrics SHALL be collected in External API registry
- **AND** SHALL be clearly labeled as external database traffic

### Requirement: Metric Registry Interface

Each metric registry SHALL implement a consistent interface for metric collection and reporting.

#### Scenario: Registry Creation and Configuration

- **WHEN** a service initializes a metric registry
- **THEN** the registry SHALL be configured with domain-appropriate label sets
- **AND** SHALL provide methods for registering and updating metrics
- **AND** SHALL support metric export to Prometheus format

#### Scenario: Cross-Registry Metric Isolation

- **WHEN** multiple registries collect metrics simultaneously
- **THEN** each registry SHALL maintain separate label spaces
- **AND** SHALL NOT pollute other registries with domain-inappropriate labels
- **AND** SHALL provide clear metric naming to avoid collisions

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Prometheus Metrics Collection

The observability system SHALL collect and export Prometheus metrics for system monitoring and alerting.

#### Scenario: Metric Collection Performance

- **GIVEN** domain-specific metric registries are implemented
- **WHEN** metrics are collected across multiple operational domains
- **THEN** collection performance SHALL be maintained or improved
- **AND** memory usage for metric storage SHALL be optimized
- **AND** metric export SHALL remain compatible with existing Prometheus setup
- **AND** total number of registries SHALL be 6 (GPU, gRPC, External API, Pipeline, Cache, Reranking)
