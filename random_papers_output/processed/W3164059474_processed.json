      "text": "Kinetic regularities of cathode processes during electrolysis of low concentrated NaCl solutions have been investigated in this work. It was shown that the reduction of hypochlorite ion on platinum in the concentration range up to  $0.015\\mathrm{M}$  is limited by the diffusion stage as evidenced by linear dependence of the reciprocal limiting current density versus reciprocal square root of the electrode rotation rate. The diffusion coefficient of  $\\mathrm{ClO^{-}}$  ions to the Pt-RDE surface was calculated from the Koutecki-Levich equation and it was  $6.6\\cdot 10^{-6}\\mathrm{cm}^2\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ . It was stated that the cathode material has a significant effect on the overvoltage of hypochlorite ion reduction. For example, on platinum, the beginning of the current increase corresponding to the reduction of  $\\mathrm{ClO^{-}}$  is observed at  $+0.3\\mathrm{V}$ , whereas it is  $-0.25\\mathrm{V}$  on steel and nickel and  $-0.8\\mathrm{V}$  on titanium. The preparation of a platinum electrode, which affects the texture and condition of the surface, also affects the reduction potential of the hypochlorite ion. Thus, the current increase is observed at  $+0.1\\mathrm{V}$  on a molded and machined Pt-RDE, while the growth of the current is observed at  $+0.3\\mathrm{V}$  on a flat Pt electrode etched in aqua regia. The potentials of the beginning of hydrogen evolution are practically indistinguishable. It was shown that the electrolysis of NaCl solutions in an undivided cell should be performed at the maximum possible cathode current densities in order to minimize sodium hypochlorite losses due to its reduction at the cathode and reduce the rate of chlorate accumulation.",

Such constructions are in demand when locally obtaining small quantities of sodium hypochlorite solutions for disinfection, for example, small farms, veterinary clinics, at home. The use of flow-type electrochemical reactors allows one to organize the continuous production of sodium hypochlorite solutions with specified parameters. The cell can be built on the basis of flowing electrochemical cells with separated or undivided interelectrode space [1,2]. Both methods of implementing the electrolysis process have their advantages and disadvantages. The presence of the diaphragm complicates and makes the design more expensive, increases the cost of electricity, however, allows one to obtain solutions with the maximum possible concentration of sodium hypochlorite [3]. The absence of a diaphragm simplifies and reduces",

The rate of electrolyte agitation in relation to the surface of the electrodes  $(6\\times 5\\mathrm{mm})$  was varied by changing the velocity of the stirrer located in the center of the cell. The velocity of the stirrer was varied by changing the supply voltage of the DC motor and was controlled by ROs. For maximum correctness of the experiment, all conditions were reproduced, including the shape and size of the electrodes, as well as their position in the relation to the stirrer and cell boundaries. As it turns out from Fig. 2, on a fixed Pt electrode, the shape of the curves at different mixing intensities does not differ from the voltammograms on the Pt-RDE (Fig. 1). There is a linear dependence of the value of the limiting current density  $\\left(\\mathrm{j_D}\\right)$  on the speed of the stirrer, which indicates the diffusion control of the process. A similar dependence is observed on other electrode materials, which also indicates the reduction of  $\\mathrm{ClO^{-}}$  at cathode current densities above  $15 - 20\\mathrm{mAcm}^{-2}$  in the diffusion region.",

The electrodes were placed parallel to the cell walls and oriented along the bulk flow. During the experiment, the relative positions of the anode and cathode were changed. In the first experiment, the cathode was placed directly behind the anode so that the oxygen gas loop formed at the anode washes the cathode (Fig. 7). Such conditions are most favorable for the cathodic reduction of oxygen with the formation of hydrogen peroxide. In the second experiment, the cathode and anode were diametrically opposed to each other. The location of the cathode in the immediate vicinity of the anode leads to a decrease in the concentration of sodium hypochlorite and an increase in the concentration of chloride in the electrolyte bulk (Fig. 7). The decrease in the concentration of sodium hypochlorite can be associated both with an increase in the rate of electrochemical reduction at the cathode, and with the interaction of the hypochlorite ion with hydrogen peroxide by reaction (3). The increase in chlorate concentration can be explained by the possibility of reactions (1)-(2).",

      "text": "Reduction of oxygen at the cathode can be completely avoided if electrolysis is performed in an electrochemical cell with a diaphragm. However, the use of defined anode materials can minimize the amount of oxygen released. When using electrocatalysts, for example, based on palladium oxides, the current efficiency of sodium hypochlorite can reach  $95\\%$ . If even the current efficiency of oxygen is  $20\\%$  and hydrogen  $90\\%$ , the concentration of oxygen in the gas mixture released, excluding water vapor and hydrochloric acid, will not exceed  $10 \\, \\text{mol.}\\%$ . The electrolyte in the cathode space will be maximally enriched with hydrogen due to the intense release of the latter. As one can see from Table 5, even blowing the cathode with pure oxygen does not lead to a significant increase in the concentration of chlorate and a corresponding decrease in the content of hypochlorite.",

      "text": "Kinetic regularities of cathode processes during electrolysis of low concentrated NaCl solutions have been investigated in this work. It was shown that the reduction of hypochlorite ion on platinum in the concentration range up to  $0.015\\mathrm{M}$  is limited by the diffusion stage as evidenced by linear dependence of the reciprocal limiting current density versus reciprocal square root of the electrode rotation rate. The diffusion coefficient of  $\\mathrm{ClO^{-}}$  ions to the Pt-RDE surface was calculated from the Koutecki-Levich equation and it was  $6.6\\cdot 10^{-6}\\mathrm{cm}^2\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ . It was stated that the cathode material has a significant effect on the overvoltage of hypochlorite ion reduction. For example, on platinum, the beginning of the current increase corresponding to the reduction of  $\\mathrm{ClO^{-}}$  is observed at  $+0.3\\mathrm{V}$ , whereas it is  $-0.25\\mathrm{V}$  on steel and nickel and  $-0.8\\mathrm{V}$  on titanium. The preparation of a platinum electrode, which affects the texture and condition of the surface, also affects the reduction potential of the hypochlorite ion. Thus, the current increase is observed at  $+0.1\\mathrm{V}$  on a molded and machined Pt-RDE, while the growth of the current is observed at  $+0.3\\mathrm{V}$  on a flat Pt electrode etched in aqua regia. The potentials of the beginning of hydrogen evolution are practically indistinguishable. It was shown that the electrolysis of NaCl solutions in an undivided cell should be performed at the maximum possible cathode current densities in order to minimize sodium hypochlorite losses due to its reduction at the cathode and reduce the rate of chlorate accumulation.",
