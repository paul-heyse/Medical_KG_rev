The system SHALL provide SPLADE-v3 retrieval with Rep-Max aggregation for learned sparse retrieval.

#### Scenario: SPLADE chunk segmentation
- **WHEN** processing chunks for SPLADE indexing
- **THEN** the system SHALL segment chunks into â‰¤512-token segments
- **AND** SHALL use the same SPLADE tokenizer for chunking and retrieval
- **AND** SHALL maintain segment order and boundaries for aggregation

- **AND** SHALL apply sparsity thresholds and quantization
- **AND** SHALL store as Lucene impact index for efficient retrieval

#### Scenario: SPLADE query processing
- **WHEN** processing a search query for SPLADE
- **THEN** the system SHALL encode the query with SPLADE tokenizer/model
- **AND** SHALL score against the SPLADE impact index
- **AND** SHALL return ranked results with sparse similarity scores
- **AND** SHALL include query preprocessing and normalization

### Requirement: Qwen3 Dense Retrieval
The system SHALL provide Qwen3 4096-dimension dense retrieval for semantic search.

#### Scenario: Qwen3 query processing
- **WHEN** processing a search query for Qwen3
- **THEN** the system SHALL generate query embedding with Qwen3 model
- **AND** SHALL perform ANN search against Qwen3 index
- **AND** SHALL return ranked results with cosine similarity scores
- **AND** SHALL include vector normalization and distance calculation

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Retrieval Service Interface
The retrieval service interface SHALL support hybrid retrieval combining multiple strategies.

#### Scenario: Hybrid retrieval configuration
- **WHEN** configuring retrieval strategies
- **THEN** the service SHALL allow selection of BM25, SPLADE, Qwen3, or hybrid modes
- **AND** SHALL support feature flag control for gradual migration
- **AND** SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing retrieval APIs
- **AND** SHALL provide method-specific configuration options

#### Scenario: Retrieval performance optimization
- **WHEN** executing retrieval operations
- **THEN** the service SHALL optimize for query performance across strategies
- **AND** SHALL implement caching for repeated queries
- **AND** SHALL provide query result caching and invalidation
- **AND** SHALL monitor retrieval performance and accuracy

## REMOVED Requirements

### Requirement: Single Retrieval Strategy Limitation
**Reason**: Replaced by hybrid retrieval system
**Migration**: Hybrid retrieval maintains backward compatibility while providing improved accuracy

The system no longer limits retrieval to a single strategy but combines multiple complementary approaches.
