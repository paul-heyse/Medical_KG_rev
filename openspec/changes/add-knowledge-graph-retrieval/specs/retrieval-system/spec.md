# Retrieval System Specification

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Multi-Strategy Retrieval

The system SHALL provide retrieval using BM25, SPLADE sparse, and dense vectors with fusion ranking.

#### Scenario: Fusion ranking

- **WHEN** query is executed
- **THEN** results from BM25, SPLADE, and dense MUST be fused using RRF

#### Scenario: P95 latency requirement

- **WHEN** retrieval is performed
- **THEN** P95 latency MUST be under 500ms

### Requirement: Semantic Chunking

The system SHALL chunk documents into semantic units (paragraphs, sections) while respecting token limits.

#### Scenario: Section-aware chunking

- **WHEN** chunking academic paper
- **THEN** Introduction, Methods, Results sections MUST be preserved as logical units

### Requirement: Advanced Chunking Strategies
The system SHALL provide multiple chunking strategies preserving different semantic boundaries.

#### Scenario: Paragraph-aware chunking
- **WHEN** chunking with paragraph strategy
- **THEN** chunks MUST align with paragraph boundaries (double newlines)

#### Scenario: Table-aware chunking
- **WHEN** document contains tables
- **THEN** tables MUST remain intact within single chunks

#### Scenario: Chunk overlap for context
- **WHEN** using sliding window strategy
- **THEN** chunks MUST overlap by configured percentage for context continuity

### Requirement: Cross-Encoder Reranking
The system SHALL optionally rerank retrieval results using a cross-encoder model for improved relevance.

#### Scenario: Reranking activation
- **WHEN** query includes rerank=true parameter
- **THEN** system MUST apply cross-encoder to top-k results

#### Scenario: Dual scoring
- **WHEN** reranking is applied
- **THEN** results MUST include both retrieval_score and rerank_score

### Requirement: Span Highlighting
The system SHALL highlight matching text spans in retrieval results.

#### Scenario: Query term highlighting
- **WHEN** retrieving results
- **THEN** response MUST include highlighted spans with character offsets and text
