## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Pluggable Stage Plugin System

The orchestration runtime SHALL support dynamic discovery and loading of stage implementations through a plugin system.

#### Scenario: Plugin Discovery and Registration

- **WHEN** the Dagster runtime initializes
- **AND** stage plugins are installed via entry points
- **THEN** the runtime SHALL discover and register available stage types
- **AND** make them available for pipeline execution
- **AND** provide fallback to built-in implementations for missing plugin types

#### Scenario: Plugin-Based Stage Creation

- **WHEN** a pipeline configuration references a stage type
- **THEN** the runtime SHALL first check registered plugins for that stage type
- **AND** if found, instantiate the stage using the plugin's factory method
- **AND** if not found, fall back to built-in stage implementations
- **AND** provide clear error messages for missing stage types

#### Scenario: Plugin Lifecycle Management

- **WHEN** plugins are loaded at runtime
- **THEN** the system SHALL validate plugin metadata and capabilities
- **AND** track plugin versions and dependencies
- **AND** provide graceful handling of plugin loading failures
- **AND** allow hot-reloading of plugins in development mode
- **AND** enforce plugin isolation and resource limits
- **AND** monitor plugin health and performance
- **AND** handle plugin dependency chains and loading order
- **AND** provide plugin security boundaries and access control

### Requirement: StagePlugin Protocol

Stage plugins SHALL implement a standardized protocol for stage creation and metadata reporting.

#### Scenario: Plugin Implementation Requirements

- **GIVEN** a stage plugin implementing the StagePlugin protocol
- **WHEN** the plugin is registered via entry points
- **THEN** it SHALL provide a create_stage() method that accepts StageDefinition
- **AND** return a stage instance compatible with the orchestration runtime
- **AND** expose metadata including name, version, and supported stage types

#### Scenario: Plugin Metadata Validation

- **WHEN** a plugin is discovered and loaded
- **THEN** the system SHALL validate plugin metadata schema
- **AND** ensure required fields are present and valid
- **AND** check for conflicts with existing plugin stage types
- **AND** reject plugins with invalid or missing metadata

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Stage Resolution and Discovery

The StageFactory SHALL support both plugin-based and built-in stage resolution with clear precedence rules.

#### Scenario: Stage Resolution Precedence

- **WHEN** resolving a stage type during pipeline execution
- **THEN** the factory SHALL first check registered plugins
- **AND** if no plugin provides the stage type, fall back to built-in implementations
- **AND** provide detailed logging about resolution path and source
- **AND** maintain performance characteristics of built-in resolution

#### Scenario: Mixed Plugin and Built-in Pipelines

- **GIVEN** a pipeline using both plugin-provided and built-in stages
- **WHEN** the pipeline executes
- **THEN** all stages SHALL execute correctly regardless of their source
- **AND** stage outputs SHALL be compatible across plugin boundaries
- **AND** error handling SHALL work consistently for all stage types
