## 🎯 Executive Summary

### System Overview

Medical_KG_rev is a sophisticated, production-ready multi-protocol API gateway and orchestration system designed to unify fragmented biomedical data from diverse sources into a coherent knowledge graph with advanced retrieval capabilities. The system addresses the critical challenge faced by healthcare researchers, pharmaceutical companies, and medical informaticists: **data fragmentation across incompatible APIs, formats, and standards**.

### Key Innovations

1. **🔌 Multi-Protocol Façade**: Single backend accessible via 5 protocols (REST, GraphQL, gRPC, SOAP, AsyncAPI/SSE)
2. **📊 Federated Data Model**: Unified Intermediate Representation (IR) with domain-specific overlays
3. **🔌 Plug-in Adapter Architecture**: YAML-based connector SDK with automatic plugin discovery
4. **🚀 GPU-Accelerated AI Pipeline**: Fail-fast GPU services for PDF parsing and embeddings
5. **🔍 Multi-Strategy Retrieval**: Hybrid search with fusion ranking for superior relevance
6. **🔐 Provenance-First Design**: Complete traceability for trust and reproducibility

### Architecture Principles

**Design Philosophy**: The system follows "fail-fast" principles for GPU services, comprehensive provenance tracking, and protocol-agnostic business logic to ensure reliability and maintainability.

**Standards Compliance**: Built on industry standards (HL7 FHIR, OpenAPI 3.1, OAuth 2.0, etc.) for long-term interoperability and regulatory compliance.

### Target Scale & Performance

- **Data Volume**: 10M+ documents, 100M+ entities, 1B+ relationships
- **Query Performance**: P95 < 500ms for retrieval queries
- **Concurrent Users**: 1000+ simultaneous API clients

## 🎯 System Architecture & Design Rationale

### Core Design Decisions

**1. Multi-Protocol Façade Pattern**

```python
# Why: Single backend serving multiple client types
# Decision: Protocol-agnostic business logic with thin protocol wrappers
# Impact: Maximum client compatibility, reduced duplication
```

The system implements a façade pattern where all protocols share the same business logic layer, with thin protocol-specific wrappers. This ensures consistency while supporting diverse client ecosystems.

**2. Fail-Fast GPU Services**

```python
# Why: GPU resources are expensive and failures should be immediate
# Decision: Explicit GPU availability checks with immediate failure
# Impact: Clear error states, no silent performance degradation
```

GPU services implement strict availability checks and fail immediately if requirements aren't met, preventing silent CPU fallback that would degrade performance expectations.

**3. Provenance-First Data Model**

```python
# Why: Trust and reproducibility in biomedical research
# Decision: Every fact traceable to source, method, and timestamp
# Impact: Regulatory compliance, research reproducibility
```

All extracted knowledge includes complete provenance chains, enabling trust in research findings and meeting regulatory requirements for medical data handling.

### Architecture Patterns

**Adapter Pattern (Pluggy Framework)**

```python
# Data source abstraction with standardized lifecycle
class BaseAdapter(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    async def fetch(self, request: AdapterRequest) -> AdapterResponse: ...
    @abstractmethod
    async def parse(self, response: AdapterResponse) -> Document: ...
    @abstractmethod
    async def validate(self, document: Document) -> ValidationResult: ...
```

**Repository Pattern (Job Ledger)**

```python
# Persistence abstraction for state management
class LedgerRepository(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    async def create_job(self, job: Job) -> Job: ...
    @abstractmethod
    async def update_status(self, job_id: str, status: JobStatus) -> None: ...
    @abstractmethod
    async def get_job_history(self, job_id: str) -> List[JobEvent]: ...
```

**Strategy Pattern (Multi-Strategy Retrieval)**

```python
# Pluggable retrieval algorithms with fusion ranking
class RetrievalStrategy(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    async def search(self, query: str) -> List[SearchResult]: ...

class HybridRetrieval:
    def __init__(self, strategies: List[RetrievalStrategy]):
        self.strategies = strategies

    async def search(self, query: str) -> List[SearchResult]:
        results = await asyncio.gather(*[s.search(query) for s in self.strategies])
        return self.fusion_rank(results)  # RRF fusion
```

### Standards Compliance

**Security & Identity:**

- **OAuth 2.0** (authentication & authorization with JWT)
- **RFC 7807** (Problem Details for HTTP APIs)
- **RFC 6750** (Bearer Token Usage)

**Healthcare & Biomedical:**

- **HL7 FHIR R5** (medical domain alignment)
- **UCUM** (Unified Code for Units of Measure)
- **SHACL** (Shapes Constraint Language for graph validation)
- **RxNorm** (NLM drug terminology)
- **ICD-11** (WHO disease classification)
- **MeSH** (Medical Subject Headings)

**Data & Processing:**

- **Unicode** (text processing and normalization)

## ⚖️ Assumptions & Constraints

### Core Assumptions

**1. GPU Availability for AI Services**

- **Assumption**: GPU resources are available for PDF parsing, embeddings, and LLM extraction
- **Rationale**: CPU fallback would provide unacceptable performance for production workloads
- **Impact**: Services fail immediately if GPU unavailable; explicit resource requirements in deployment

**2. Network Connectivity for External APIs**

- **Assumption**: Reliable network connectivity to 11+ external biomedical data sources
- **Rationale**: Biomedical data sources may have rate limits, outages, or API changes
- **Impact**: Comprehensive retry logic, circuit breakers, and graceful degradation strategies

**3. Structured Data from Biomedical Sources**

- **Assumption**: External APIs provide structured data that can be normalized to IR format
- **Rationale**: Biomedical data varies significantly in format and completeness
- **Impact**: Robust parsing logic, validation pipelines, and fallback handling for malformed data

**4. Regulatory Compliance Requirements**

- **Assumption**: System must maintain audit trails and provenance for regulatory compliance
- **Rationale**: Healthcare and pharmaceutical use cases require complete data traceability
- **Impact**: Comprehensive audit logging, provenance tracking, and data retention policies

### System Constraints

    "pubmed_central": {"requests_per_second": 3, "daily_quota": 5000},
    # ... additional API constraints
}
```

**4. Data Quality Constraints**

```python
# Quality thresholds for ingestion pipeline
QUALITY_THRESHOLDS = {
    "minimum_text_length": 50,  # Characters
    "maximum_processing_time": 300,  # Seconds per document
    "required_metadata_fields": ["title", "source", "created_date"],
