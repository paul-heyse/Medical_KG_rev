# Codebase Reduction Report: Parsing & Chunking

To validate the legacy decommissioning, `cloc` was run against the previous
commit (legacy code) and the updated implementation.

## Measurement Commands

```bash
# Legacy snapshot (HEAD~1)
git worktree add /tmp/old HEAD~1
perl /tmp/cloc-1.98/cloc /tmp/old/src/Medical_KG_rev/chunking

# New implementation
perl /tmp/cloc-1.98/cloc src/Medical_KG_rev/services/chunking src/Medical_KG_rev/services/parsing
```

## Results

| Scope | Files | Code Lines |
|-------|-------|------------|
| Legacy chunking package (`src/Medical_KG_rev/chunking`) | 37 | 3,960 |
| New chunking/parsing services (`src/Medical_KG_rev/services/chunking`, `src/Medical_KG_rev/services/parsing`) | 20 | 1,382 |

## Reduction Summary

- Absolute reduction: **2,578** lines of code
- Relative reduction: **65.1%** decrease in chunking/parsing code footprint
- Legacy modules fully removed (see `DELETED_CODE.md`)

These measurements satisfy the â‰¥40% reduction target defined in the OpenSpec
implementation plan.
