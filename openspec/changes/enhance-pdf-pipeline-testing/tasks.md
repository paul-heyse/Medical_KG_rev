**Total Tasks**: 60 across 7 work streams

**Risk Assessment:**

- **Low Risk**: Testing enhancements don't affect production functionality
- **Medium Risk**: Comprehensive testing could reveal existing bugs that need fixing

**Rollback Plan**: If test implementation reveals critical issues, scale back to infrastructure-only testing while keeping enhanced test framework for future use.
