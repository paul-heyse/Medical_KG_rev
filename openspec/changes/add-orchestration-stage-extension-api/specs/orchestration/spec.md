## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Orchestration Stage Extension API

The system SHALL provide an extension API allowing teams to implement and register custom stage types dynamically without modifying core runtime code.

#### Scenario: Plugin-Based Stage Implementation

- **GIVEN** a pipeline configuration declares a stage with type "download"
- **WHEN** the runtime resolves stage implementations
- **THEN** it SHALL discover and use plugin-provided stage handlers
- **AND** fall back gracefully when no plugin provides the required stage type
- **AND** provide clear error messages for missing implementations

#### Scenario: Dynamic Stage Discovery

- **WHEN** the Dagster runtime initializes
- **THEN** it SHALL scan for installed stage plugins via entry points
- **AND** register available stage types and their implementations
- **AND** validate plugin metadata and capabilities
- **AND** make plugin-provided stages available for pipeline execution

#### Scenario: Plugin Development and Distribution

- **GIVEN** a team needs to implement a custom stage type
- **WHEN** they create a stage plugin following the StagePlugin protocol
- **THEN** they SHALL be able to register it via entry points
- **AND** the runtime SHALL discover and use their implementation
- **AND** without requiring changes to the core Medical_KG_rev codebase

### Requirement: StagePlugin Protocol Standardization

Stage plugins SHALL implement a standardized protocol for stage creation, metadata reporting, and lifecycle management.

#### Scenario: Plugin Interface Requirements

- **GIVEN** a stage plugin implementing the protocol
- **WHEN** registered with the runtime
- **THEN** it SHALL provide a create_stage() method accepting StageDefinition
- **AND** return stage instances compatible with the orchestration runtime
- **AND** expose metadata including supported stage types and version information

#### Scenario: Plugin Validation and Error Handling

- **WHEN** plugins are loaded at runtime
- **THEN** the system SHALL validate plugin implementations
- **AND** check for required methods and metadata
- **AND** handle plugin loading failures gracefully
- **AND** provide detailed error messages for invalid plugins

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Stage Type Resolution

The runtime SHALL resolve stage types dynamically from plugins with fallback to built-in implementations.

#### Scenario: Resolution Priority and Fallback

- **WHEN** resolving a stage type during pipeline execution
- **THEN** the runtime SHALL first check registered plugins
- **AND** if no plugin provides the stage type, use built-in implementations
- **AND** maintain backward compatibility with existing hardcoded stages
- **AND** provide clear logging about resolution source and method

#### Scenario: Mixed Plugin and Built-in Execution

- **GIVEN** a pipeline using both plugin-provided and built-in stages
- **WHEN** the pipeline executes
- **THEN** all stages SHALL execute correctly regardless of implementation source
- **AND** stage contracts SHALL be consistent across plugin boundaries
- **AND** error handling SHALL work uniformly for all stage types
