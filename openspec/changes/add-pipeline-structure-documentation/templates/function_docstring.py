"""

# Real example for _extract_text method:

"""Extract document text from chunking request.

Extracts document text from ChunkingRequest, checking request.text first for
backwards compatibility, then falling back to request.options["text"]. Validates
that the extracted text is non-empty and raises InvalidDocumentError if no
valid text is found.

This method exists to provide a consistent interface for text extraction across
different request formats while maintaining backwards compatibility with older
API versions that used request.text directly.

Args:
    job_id: Unique job identifier for error reporting and logging
    request: ChunkingRequest containing document text in either request.text
        or request.options["text"]. Must have tenant_id and document_id.

Returns:
    str: Non-empty document text ready for chunking. Will never be empty
        or whitespace-only as this raises InvalidDocumentError.

Raises:
    InvalidDocumentError: If no valid text is found in either request.text
        or request.options["text"], or if the found text is empty/whitespace.
        Exception message includes the specific validation failure reason.

Note:
    Performance: O(1) time complexity for text extraction
    Thread safety: Not thread-safe if request object is modified concurrently
    Side effects: None (pure function)

Example:
    >>> request = ChunkingRequest(
    ...     tenant_id="tenant1",
    ...     document_id="doc1",
    ...     text="Sample document text for chunking."
    ... )
    >>> text = coordinator._extract_text("job-123", request)
    >>> assert text == "Sample document text for chunking."
    >>> # Raises InvalidDocumentError if text is empty
"""

# Real example for _execute method:

"""Execute synchronous chunking operation with full lifecycle management.

Executes a complete chunking operation by creating a job, extracting text,
creating a ChunkCommand, calling the chunking service, handling exceptions,
assembling results, and marking the job as completed. This is the main
entry point for chunking operations and handles all error translation
and lifecycle management.

The method implements a complete chunking workflow:
1. Create job in lifecycle manager
2. Extract and validate document text
3. Create ChunkCommand with chunking parameters
4. Call ChunkingService to perform actual chunking
5. Translate any exceptions to coordinator errors
6. Assemble DocumentChunk objects with metadata
7. Mark job as completed with results
8. Return ChunkingResult with chunks and metadata

Args:
    request: ChunkingRequest with document_id, text (or in options),
        chunking strategy, chunk_size, overlap, and additional options.
        Must have valid tenant_id for job tracking.

Returns:
    ChunkingResult: Contains job_id, duration_s, chunks (sequence of
        DocumentChunk objects), and metadata with chunk count and
        strategy used. Never returns None.

Raises:
    CoordinatorError: For all handled errors after translation from
        chunking exceptions. Contains ProblemDetail with HTTP status
        code, error message, and retry information if applicable.
        Common error types: ProfileNotFoundError, ChunkingFailedError,
        InvalidDocumentError, ChunkingUnavailableError.

Note:
    Performance: O(n) time complexity where n is document length
    Thread safety: Not thread-safe due to shared lifecycle manager
    Side effects: Creates job entry, emits metrics, logs operations

Example:
    >>> request = ChunkingRequest(
    ...     tenant_id="tenant1",
    ...     document_id="doc1",
    ...     text="Sample document text for chunking.",
    ...     strategy="section",
    ...     chunk_size=512
    ... )
    >>> result = coordinator.execute(request)
    >>> print(f"Job {result.job_id} completed in {result.duration_s:.2f}s")
    >>> print(f"Generated {len(result.chunks)} chunks")
