## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Composable MinerU Service Architecture

The MinerU service SHALL be decomposed into composable components with clear interfaces for CLI coordination, execution backends, and fallback strategies.

#### Scenario: Component-Based Service Design

- **GIVEN** the MinerU service architecture
- **WHEN** implementing PDF processing functionality
- **THEN** the service SHALL be composed of focused components
- **AND** each component SHALL have a single responsibility
- **AND** components SHALL be substitutable for testing and alternative implementations

#### Scenario: Dependency Injection and Composition

- **WHEN** initializing the MinerU service
- **THEN** components SHALL be assembled through dependency injection
- **AND** configuration SHALL drive component selection and wiring
- **AND** service lifecycle SHALL be managed centrally
- **AND** component interactions SHALL be clearly defined through interfaces

#### Scenario: Strategy Pattern for Execution Modes

- **GIVEN** different execution requirements (GPU vs simulated)
- **WHEN** processing PDF documents
- **THEN** the service SHALL use strategy classes to select execution modes
- **AND** fallback logic SHALL be explicit and configurable
- **AND** execution strategies SHALL be testable in isolation
- **AND** strategy selection SHALL be based on runtime conditions

### Requirement: Service Interface Definitions

The MinerU service SHALL define clear interfaces for worker management, execution backends, and fallback strategies.

#### Scenario: Worker Interface for CLI Lifecycle

- **GIVEN** the MineruWorker interface
- **WHEN** managing CLI process lifecycle
- **THEN** it SHALL provide methods for process initialization, execution, and cleanup
- **AND** handle CLI-specific configuration and environment setup
- **AND** manage process lifecycle and resource cleanup
- **AND** provide health checking and monitoring integration

#### Scenario: Backend Interface for PDF Processing

- **GIVEN** the OCRBackend interface
- **WHEN** executing PDF processing operations
- **THEN** it SHALL define methods for document processing and result formatting
- **AND** handle different execution modes (GPU vs simulated)
- **AND** provide consistent response formats across implementations
- **AND** support metadata extraction and error reporting

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: MinerU Service Implementation

The MinerU service SHALL use a composable architecture with clear separation of concerns for CLI coordination, execution, and fallback handling.

#### Scenario: Component Assembly and Configuration

- **WHEN** deploying the MinerU service
- **THEN** components SHALL be assembled based on configuration
- **AND** different backends SHALL be selectable based on environment
- **AND** fallback strategies SHALL be configurable per deployment
- **AND** service composition SHALL be transparent and debuggable

#### Scenario: Execution Strategy Selection

- **GIVEN** the strategy pattern implementation
- **WHEN** determining execution approach for PDF processing
- **THEN** the system SHALL evaluate runtime conditions (GPU availability, etc.)
- **AND** select appropriate execution strategy automatically
- **AND** provide fallback mechanisms for strategy failures
- **AND** maintain consistent behavior across different execution modes
