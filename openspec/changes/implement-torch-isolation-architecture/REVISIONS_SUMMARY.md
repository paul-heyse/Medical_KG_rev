## Date

2025-10-10

## Status

✅ **All critical revisions completed** - Change proposal now aligns with project architectural standards and best practices.

## Overview

This document summarizes the comprehensive revisions made to the `implement-torch-isolation-architecture` change proposal based on the holistic architectural review. All Priority 1 (Critical) and Priority 2 (Important) issues have been addressed.

---

## Critical Issues Resolved (Priority 1)

### 1. ✅ Protocol Changed from HTTP to gRPC

**Issue**: Original proposal used HTTP/REST for service communication, violating project standard: "Use gRPC for inter-service communication (not REST)" for GPU services.

**Changes Made**:

- **proposal.md**: Updated all references from "HTTP API" to "gRPC API"
- **design.md**:
  - Section 1: Replaced HTTP client examples with gRPC client examples using proto definitions
  - Section 2: Updated Docker containers to expose gRPC ports (50051) instead of HTTP
  - Section 3: Revised circuit breaker to use gRPC error codes for classification
  - Section 5: Changed service discovery to use gRPC health check protocol
  - Added mTLS authentication section (Section 6)
- **tasks.md**: Updated 40+ tasks to use gRPC instead of HTTP:
  - gRPC service definitions (proto files)
  - gRPC server implementations instead of FastAPI
  - gRPC health check protocol instead of HTTP health endpoints
  - grpc_health_probe for Docker HEALTHCHECK commands

**Rationale**: gRPC provides better performance, type safety, and aligns with existing project infrastructure.

### 2. ✅ Docling Integration Clarified

**Issue**: Ambiguous relationship with concurrent `replace-mineru-with-docling-vlm` change proposal.

**Changes Made**:

- **proposal.md**: Added explicit dependency note stating Docling integration is prerequisite
- **design.md** Section 4:
  - Added "Prerequisite" callout explaining Docling must be operational first
  - Clarified that this change consumes Docling's output, not implements Docling
  - Updated code examples to show using Docling's pre-processed results
  - Noted Docling runs in its own GPU container from separate change

**Outcome**: Clear separation of concerns - `replace-mineru-with-docling-vlm` handles Docling integration, this change removes torch from main gateway.

### 3. ✅ Fail-Fast Semantics Preserved

**Issue**: Circuit breakers might hide GPU failures instead of failing fast per project philosophy.

**Changes Made**:

- **design.md** Section 3:
  - Added explicit distinction between network failures (circuit breaker) and GPU unavailability (fail-fast)
  - Updated code examples to classify gRPC error codes:
    - `UNAVAILABLE` → network issue → circuit breaker
    - `FAILED_PRECONDITION` → GPU unavailable → fail fast
  - Added documentation emphasizing circuit breakers are for network issues only
- **design.md** Section 7 (Dagster Integration):
  - Showed fail-fast behavior in Dagster assets
  - GPU unavailability raises exception and fails entire Dagster run
- **tasks.md**: Updated circuit breaker tasks to clarify "network failures only"

**Outcome**: Maintains fail-fast philosophy while providing resilience for network issues.

---

## Important Issues Resolved (Priority 2)

### 4. ✅ Dagster Integration Added

**Issue**: No details on how Dagster pipeline orchestration integrates with GPU services.

**Changes Made**:

- **design.md**: Added new Section 7 "Dagster Integration" with:
  - Complete code examples showing Dagster assets using gRPC clients
  - Dagster resource configuration for GPU services
  - Error handling distinguishing network vs GPU failures
  - Tenant context propagation through Dagster
  - Job configuration examples
- **tasks.md**: Added new Section 11 "Dagster Integration" with 5 subsections:
  - 11.1: Update Dagster assets to use gRPC clients
  - 11.2: Create Dagster resources for GPU services
  - 11.3: Update Dagster job configurations
  - 11.4: Create Dagster integration tests
  - 11.5: Update Dagster monitoring and observability
- Renumbered all subsequent sections (Security → Section 12, Performance → Section 13, etc.)

**Outcome**: Complete integration path for two-phase pipeline with GPU services.

### 5. ✅ Service Authentication Specified

**Issue**: Service authentication mechanism was listed as "Open Question".

**Changes Made**:

- **design.md**: Added new Section 6 "Service-to-Service Authentication" with:
  - Decision to use mutual TLS (mTLS)
  - Complete code examples for mTLS client and server setup
  - Certificate management approach
  - Rationale and alternatives considered
- **tasks.md** Section 12.1: Added comprehensive mTLS implementation tasks:
  - CA certificate generation
  - Service and client certificate creation
  - gRPC server and client configuration for mTLS
  - Certificate rotation procedures
- **design.md** Open Questions: Removed authentication question (now answered)

**Outcome**: Clear security model with industry-standard mTLS authentication.

### 6. ✅ Backward Compatibility Addressed

**Issue**: No migration path or feature flag for gradual rollout.

**Changes Made**:

- **design.md** Open Questions: Added recommendation for feature flag (`USE_GPU_SERVICES=true/false`)
- Mentioned compatibility layer for gradual migration
- Documented rollback strategy

**Outcome**: Safer migration path with ability to rollback if issues arise.

---

## Additional Improvements (Priority 3)

### 7. ✅ Latency SLOs Added

**Changes Made**:

- **design.md** Risk section: Added specific SLOs:
  - Service call overhead < 10ms P95
  - Total embedding generation latency < 500ms P95
- Added mitigation strategies specific to gRPC (HTTP/2 multiplexing, streaming, keepalive)

### 8. ✅ Distributed Tracing Added

**Changes Made**:

- **proposal.md**: Added OpenTelemetry to dependencies
- **design.md** Section 3: Added OpenTelemetry trace context propagation in circuit breaker
- **design.md** Section 7: Showed trace propagation from Dagster to GPU services
- **tasks.md**: Multiple tasks updated to include OpenTelemetry tracing
  - gRPC interceptors for tracing
  - Trace context in gRPC metadata
  - Dagster to service trace propagation

### 9. ✅ Multi-Tenancy Considerations

**Changes Made**:

- **design.md** Open Questions: Added multi-tenancy recommendation
- **tasks.md**: Updated multiple tasks to include tenant_id propagation in gRPC metadata
- **tasks.md** Section 12.4: Audit logging includes tenant_id from gRPC metadata

### 10. ✅ Service Consolidation Guidance

**Changes Made**:

- **design.md** Open Questions: Added recommendation on service consolidation
- Start with separate services for clear isolation
- Consolidate if operational overhead becomes high

## Key Architectural Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| **gRPC over HTTP/REST** | Aligns with project standards, better performance, type safety |
| **mTLS Authentication** | Strong mutual authentication without additional infrastructure |
| **Circuit Breakers for Network Only** | Preserves fail-fast philosophy for GPU unavailability |
| **Docling as Prerequisite** | Clear dependency chain, separation of concerns |
| **Dagster gRPC Resources** | Keeps Dagster workers torch-free while enabling GPU operations |
| **OpenTelemetry Tracing** | End-to-end observability across service boundaries |
| **Tenant ID in gRPC Metadata** | Multi-tenancy support without breaking existing patterns |

---

## Implementation Readiness

The change proposal is now ready for AI agent implementation with:

✅ **Complete technical specifications** across all 16 sections
✅ **Alignment with project architecture** (gRPC, fail-fast, multi-tenancy)
✅ **Clear integration points** (Dagster, gateway, services)
✅ **Comprehensive task breakdown** (500+ subtasks)
✅ **Security and compliance considerations**
✅ **Validation and quality assurance plans**
✅ **Deployment and rollback procedures**

## Next Steps

1. **Review and approve** the revised change proposal
2. **Prioritize dependencies**: Ensure `replace-mineru-with-docling-vlm` completes first
3. **Begin implementation** following tasks.md sequentially
4. **Continuous validation** using openspec throughout implementation
5. **Archive after deployment** per OpenSpec Stage 3 workflow

- **Preserves** fail-fast philosophy with clear error classification
- **Integrates** with Dagster orchestration layer
- **Secures** service communication with mTLS
