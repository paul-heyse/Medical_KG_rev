## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Structured Chunking Interface
The chunking system SHALL use a structured `ChunkCommand` dataclass to clearly document required inputs and hide implementation details from callers.

#### Scenario: Command-Based Chunking Interface
- **GIVEN** the `ChunkCommand` dataclass for chunking operations
- **WHEN** callers need to perform document chunking
- **THEN** they SHALL construct a `ChunkCommand` with explicit fields for tenant, document, text, options, and context
- **AND** the command SHALL validate all required inputs before processing
- **AND** hide argument normalization and stage execution details from callers
- **AND** provide clear error messages for missing or invalid parameters

#### Scenario: Command Validation and Enrichment
- **GIVEN** a `ChunkCommand` instance
- **WHEN** submitted for processing
- **THEN** it SHALL validate all required fields and data types
- **AND** enrich with tenant, correlation, and timing metadata
- **AND** provide serialization for logging and debugging
- **AND** support comparison and validation utilities for testing

#### Scenario: Command Context Preservation
- **GIVEN** chunking operations with error conditions
- **WHEN** failures occur during processing
- **THEN** the command SHALL preserve context for error correlation
- **AND** include request timing and resource usage information
- **AND** support error categorization and severity classification
- **AND** enable debugging and troubleshooting with preserved context

### Requirement: Centralized Chunking Error Handling
The system SHALL provide a `ChunkingErrorTranslator` that centralizes error mapping logic and makes error handling reusable across all protocol handlers.

#### Scenario: Error Translation and Mapping
- **GIVEN** domain exceptions from chunking operations
- **WHEN** errors need to be returned to API clients
- **THEN** the translator SHALL convert domain exceptions to protocol-agnostic error types
- **AND** provide contextual error information and actionable guidance
- **AND** categorize errors by failure mode (validation, processing, resource)
- **AND** support error aggregation for batch operations

#### Scenario: Error Context and Correlation
- **GIVEN** chunking errors with associated context
- **WHEN** errors are translated for API responses
- **THEN** error responses SHALL include request context and timing information
- **AND** preserve error correlation for debugging across service boundaries
- **AND** provide error severity classification for monitoring and alerting
- **AND** support error filtering and suppression for expected failures

#### Scenario: Protocol-Agnostic Error Handling
- **GIVEN** the `ChunkingErrorTranslator` for error mapping
- **WHEN** used across different protocol handlers (REST, GraphQL, gRPC, SOAP, SSE)
- **THEN** it SHALL provide consistent error formatting and categorization
- **AND** translate errors to protocol-specific response formats
- **AND** maintain error context across protocol boundaries
- **AND** support error correlation and debugging across protocols

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Chunking Service Interface
The chunking service SHALL use structured command objects and centralized error handling to improve interface clarity and enable consistent error handling across all protocol integrations.

#### Scenario: Structured Command Processing
- **WHEN** the chunking service processes requests
- **THEN** it SHALL accept `ChunkCommand` objects with validated inputs
- **AND** perform command normalization and validation internally
- **AND** hide implementation details from service callers
- **AND** provide clear error messages for command validation failures

#### Scenario: Error Handling Integration
- **GIVEN** chunking operations with integrated error handling
- **WHEN** errors occur during chunking processing
- **THEN** the service SHALL use `ChunkingErrorTranslator` for error mapping
- **AND** provide contextual error information for troubleshooting
- **AND** support error categorization and severity classification
- **AND** maintain error context for debugging and monitoring

#### Scenario: Performance and Monitoring Integration
- **GIVEN** chunking operations with performance monitoring
- **WHEN** commands are processed through the chunking pipeline
- **THEN** the service SHALL collect and report performance metrics
- **AND** support distributed tracing for chunking operations
- **AND** provide performance profiling and optimization capabilities
- **AND** enable alerting based on chunking-specific thresholds
