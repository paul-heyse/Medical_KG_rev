## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Composable API Wiring Architecture

The API gateway SHALL use composable setup functions and a protocol plugin registry to separate infrastructure concerns from business logic and enable declarative protocol registration.

#### Scenario: Composable Application Setup

- **GIVEN** the modular API wiring architecture
- **WHEN** initializing the FastAPI application
- **THEN** setup SHALL be broken into focused functions (`setup_middleware`, `setup_routers`, etc.)
- **AND** each function SHALL handle a specific aspect of application configuration
- **AND** functions SHALL compose through dependency injection and configuration
- **AND** enable clear separation between infrastructure and business logic

#### Scenario: Protocol Plugin Registry

- **GIVEN** the protocol plugin registry system
- **WHEN** configuring enabled protocols for deployment
- **THEN** protocols SHALL register themselves declaratively through configuration
- **AND** replace hardcoded `include_router` calls with dynamic registration
- **AND** support protocol dependency resolution and ordering
- **AND** enable runtime protocol enablement/disablement

#### Scenario: Shared Presenter Helpers

- **GIVEN** reusable presenter utilities for response formatting
- **WHEN** handling errors and responses across protocol handlers
- **THEN** common patterns SHALL use shared helper methods (`presenter.not_found`, `presenter.error`)
- **AND** centralize error response formatting and categorization
- **AND** provide consistent error context and correlation
- **AND** support protocol-specific response format customization

### Requirement: AdapterQueries Abstraction

The system SHALL provide an `AdapterQueries` abstraction that centralizes resource fetching logic and error handling patterns across adapter endpoints.

#### Scenario: Centralized Resource Fetching

- **GIVEN** the `AdapterQueries` class for resource operations
- **WHEN** adapter endpoints need to fetch resources
- **THEN** they SHALL use query methods that handle validation, error mapping, and response formatting
- **AND** hide adapter discovery and invocation details from endpoint handlers
- **AND** provide consistent error handling across all adapter operations
- **AND** support query caching and performance optimization

#### Scenario: Query Error Handling Integration

- **GIVEN** adapter queries with integrated error handling
- **WHEN** errors occur during resource fetching
- **THEN** queries SHALL use shared error translation and response formatting
- **AND** preserve error context for debugging and monitoring
- **AND** provide actionable error messages for API consumers
- **AND** support error categorization and severity classification

#### Scenario: Query Performance and Monitoring

- **GIVEN** adapter queries with performance monitoring
- **WHEN** queries execute across the adapter ecosystem
- **THEN** they SHALL collect and report performance metrics
- **AND** support distributed tracing for query operations
- **AND** provide query profiling and optimization capabilities
- **AND** enable alerting based on query-specific thresholds

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: API Gateway Wiring

The API gateway SHALL use composable setup functions, protocol plugin registry, and shared abstractions to improve maintainability and enable consistent error handling across all protocol integrations.

#### Scenario: Application Composition

- **WHEN** the FastAPI application is composed from setup functions
- **THEN** each function SHALL handle a specific configuration aspect
- **AND** functions SHALL be independently testable and configurable
- **AND** support dependency injection for setup function composition
- **AND** enable runtime configuration and hot-reloading

#### Scenario: Protocol Registration and Integration

- **GIVEN** the protocol plugin registry for protocol management
- **WHEN** protocols are registered and configured
- **THEN** they SHALL provide routers, middleware, and handlers declaratively
- **AND** support protocol dependency resolution and ordering
- **AND** enable protocol-specific customization and configuration
- **AND** maintain protocol isolation and error boundaries

#### Scenario: Error Handling Consistency

- **GIVEN** shared presenter helpers and query abstractions
- **WHEN** errors occur across different protocol handlers
- **THEN** error handling SHALL be consistent and reusable
- **AND** error context SHALL be preserved for debugging
- **AND** error responses SHALL follow established patterns
- **AND** support error correlation across protocol boundaries
