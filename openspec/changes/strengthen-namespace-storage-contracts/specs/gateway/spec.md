## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Explicit Namespace and Storage Policy Contracts

The system SHALL provide clear interfaces for namespace access policies, embedding persistence, and telemetry that enable alternative implementations and improve testing isolation.

#### Scenario: NamespaceAccessPolicy Interface

- **GIVEN** the `NamespaceAccessPolicy` interface for namespace operations
- **WHEN** validating namespace access and routing
- **THEN** it SHALL provide methods for validation, routing, and access control
- **AND** support different policy implementations (standard, dry-run, mock, custom)
- **AND** enable alternative implementations for testing and development
- **AND** provide clear error messages for policy violations

#### Scenario: EmbeddingPersister Interface

- **GIVEN** the `EmbeddingPersister` interface for storage operations
- **WHEN** persisting and retrieving embeddings
- **THEN** it SHALL abstract storage operations behind a clean interface
- **AND** support different persistence strategies (vector store, database, cache)
- **AND** enable dry-run and mock implementations for testing
- **AND** provide consistent error handling and recovery

#### Scenario: EmbeddingTelemetry Interface

- **GIVEN** the `EmbeddingTelemetry` interface for metrics and monitoring
- **WHEN** collecting embedding operation metrics
- **THEN** it SHALL encapsulate metrics collection, tracing, and monitoring
- **AND** support different telemetry backends and configurations
- **AND** enable performance profiling and optimization
- **AND** provide debugging and troubleshooting capabilities

### Requirement: Interface-Based Service Composition

The gateway service SHALL use explicit interfaces for namespace, storage, and telemetry operations to enable composable implementations and improve maintainability.

#### Scenario: Interface-Driven Service Composition

- **GIVEN** the interface-based architecture for namespace and storage
- **WHEN** composing embedding services and operations
- **THEN** services SHALL depend on interfaces rather than concrete implementations
- **AND** enable runtime selection of policy, persister, and telemetry implementations
- **AND** support dependency injection and configuration-driven composition
- **AND** enable testing with mock and dry-run implementations

#### Scenario: Alternative Implementation Support

- **GIVEN** the interface-based design for namespace and storage operations
- **WHEN** implementing alternative strategies (testing, development, custom)
- **THEN** different implementations SHALL be substitutable through interface contracts
- **AND** support dry-run operations for validation without side effects
- **AND** enable mock implementations for unit testing
- **AND** support custom implementations for organization-specific requirements

#### Scenario: Performance and Monitoring Integration

- **GIVEN** interfaces with integrated performance monitoring
- **WHEN** operations execute through policy, persister, and telemetry interfaces
- **THEN** each interface SHALL collect and report performance metrics
- **AND** support distributed tracing for operation flows
- **AND** provide performance profiling and optimization capabilities
- **AND** enable alerting based on interface-specific thresholds

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Namespace and Storage Abstraction

The system SHALL use explicit interfaces for namespace access policies, embedding persistence, and telemetry to enable alternative implementations and improve service composition.

#### Scenario: Interface Contract Clarity

- **WHEN** services need to access namespaces or store embeddings
- **THEN** they SHALL use well-defined interfaces with clear contracts
- **AND** interfaces SHALL hide implementation details from service consumers
- **AND** provide consistent error handling and response formats
- **AND** enable runtime configuration and hot-reloading

#### Scenario: Implementation Flexibility

- **GIVEN** the interface-based design for namespace and storage
- **WHEN** different deployment scenarios require different implementations
- **THEN** implementations SHALL be substitutable through interface contracts
- **AND** support configuration-driven implementation selection
- **AND** enable testing and development with alternative implementations
- **AND** maintain backward compatibility with existing service integrations

#### Scenario: Operational Monitoring

- **GIVEN** interfaces with integrated monitoring capabilities
- **WHEN** operations execute through namespace and storage interfaces
- **THEN** interfaces SHALL collect operational metrics and health information
- **AND** support distributed tracing for debugging and performance analysis
- **AND** provide health checking and alerting capabilities
- **AND** enable operational troubleshooting and optimization
