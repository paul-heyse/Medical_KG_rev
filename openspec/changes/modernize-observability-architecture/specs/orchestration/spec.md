## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Typed EmbeddingStage Contracts

The ingestion pipeline SHALL use strongly-typed contracts for embedding operations instead of dynamic request fabrication.

#### Scenario: EmbeddingRequest Contract

- **WHEN** the EmbeddingStage processes text chunks
- **THEN** it SHALL construct a typed `EmbeddingRequest` object with validated parameters
- **AND** SHALL include text content, namespace, model configuration, and metadata
- **AND** SHALL validate all required fields before processing

#### Scenario: EmbeddingResult Contract

- **WHEN** embedding processing completes
- **THEN** the EmbeddingStage SHALL return a structured `EmbeddingResult` object
- **AND** SHALL include embedding vectors, processing metadata, and performance metrics
- **AND** SHALL NOT mutate the pipeline context directly

#### Scenario: EmbeddingStage Composability

- **GIVEN** typed contracts for embedding operations
- **WHEN** multiple pipeline stages interact with embedding results
- **THEN** downstream stages SHALL access structured embedding data reliably
- **AND** SHALL validate embedding result integrity before processing
- **AND** SHALL support embedding result transformation for different use cases

### Requirement: EmbeddingStage Error Handling

The EmbeddingStage SHALL provide comprehensive error handling with structured error reporting.

#### Scenario: Validation Errors

- **WHEN** invalid input is provided to EmbeddingStage
- **THEN** it SHALL raise `EmbeddingValidationError` with specific field validation details
- **AND** SHALL include correlation ID for traceability
- **AND** SHALL log validation failures for debugging

#### Scenario: Processing Errors

- **WHEN** embedding processing fails due to service issues
- **THEN** it SHALL raise `EmbeddingProcessingError` with service context
- **AND** SHALL include retry information and failure classification
- **AND** SHALL support circuit breaker state reporting

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Pipeline Stage Interface

Pipeline stages SHALL implement a consistent interface for execution and result handling.

#### Scenario: Stage Result Structure

- **GIVEN** typed contracts for stage operations
- **WHEN** a pipeline stage completes execution
- **THEN** it SHALL return a structured result object with success status and data
- **AND** SHALL include processing metadata and performance metrics
- **AND** SHALL support result validation and transformation

### Requirement: Pipeline Context Management

The pipeline context SHALL provide type-safe access to stage inputs and outputs.

#### Scenario: Context Data Access

- **GIVEN** structured stage results in pipeline context
- **WHEN** downstream stages access previous stage outputs
- **THEN** they SHALL use typed access methods with validation
- **AND** SHALL receive clear error messages for missing or invalid data
- **AND** SHALL support context data transformation for different stage requirements
