## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Separated Presentation Layer Architecture

The multi-protocol gateway SHALL separate HTTP payload shaping and response formatting from route handler business logic through a dedicated presentation layer.

#### Scenario: Presentation Layer Responsibility

- **GIVEN** the gateway architecture with separated concerns
- **WHEN** handling HTTP requests across different protocols
- **THEN** presentation logic SHALL be contained in dedicated components
- **AND** route handlers SHALL focus on business logic orchestration
- **AND** formatting concerns SHALL be reusable across protocols

#### Scenario: Dependency Injection for Route Handlers

- **WHEN** implementing route handlers for different endpoints
- **THEN** dependencies SHALL be injected rather than hardcoded
- **AND** presentation services SHALL be configurable per protocol
- **AND** route handlers SHALL be testable independently of formatting logic
- **AND** service composition SHALL be transparent and configurable

#### Scenario: Cross-Protocol Response Consistency

- **GIVEN** the shared presentation layer implementation
- **WHEN** generating responses across REST, GraphQL, and gRPC protocols
- **THEN** response formatting SHALL be consistent where applicable
- **AND** protocol-specific requirements SHALL be handled appropriately
- **AND** error responses SHALL follow unified patterns
- **AND** metadata and pagination SHALL be formatted consistently

### Requirement: Presentation Layer Interface Design

The presentation layer SHALL provide clear interfaces for response formatting, request parsing, and validation across all supported protocols.

#### Scenario: Response Formatting Interface

- **GIVEN** the ResponsePresenter interface
- **WHEN** formatting responses for different protocols
- **THEN** it SHALL provide methods for JSON:API envelope creation
- **AND** handle metadata inclusion and pagination formatting
- **AND** support error response formatting with consistent structure
- **AND** allow protocol-specific customization while maintaining consistency

#### Scenario: Request Parsing and Validation

- **GIVEN** the presentation layer request handling
- **WHEN** parsing incoming requests
- **THEN** it SHALL provide OData query parameter parsing
- **AND** validate request structure and required fields
- **AND** normalize request data for business logic consumption
- **AND** handle protocol-specific request variations consistently

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Multi-Protocol Gateway Implementation

The gateway SHALL use a separated presentation layer architecture to ensure consistent response formatting and improved maintainability across all supported protocols.

#### Scenario: Route Handler Architecture

- **WHEN** implementing route handlers for gateway endpoints
- **THEN** handlers SHALL orchestrate business logic through injected dependencies
- **AND** avoid mixing presentation concerns with business logic
- **AND** use the presentation layer for all HTTP formatting needs
- **AND** maintain clear separation between protocol handling and business logic

#### Scenario: Consistent Response Handling

- **GIVEN** the separated presentation layer
- **WHEN** generating responses across different protocol implementations
- **THEN** formatting logic SHALL be shared and reusable
- **AND** protocol-specific adaptations SHALL be handled in thin wrapper layers
- **AND** error handling SHALL be consistent across all protocols
- **AND** response structures SHALL follow established patterns
