        Determines coordinator health by checking the availability of
        all required dependencies including ChunkingService, JobLifecycleManager,
        and ChunkingErrorTranslator.

        This property provides a quick health check for monitoring
        and load balancing without performing actual chunking operations.

        Property Behavior:
            - Checks each dependency for availability
            - Returns False if any dependency is unavailable
            - Caches result for 30 seconds to avoid excessive checks
            - Updates cache when dependencies change

        Returns:
        -------
            bool: True if all dependencies are available and the coordinator
                is ready to process requests, False otherwise.

        Note:
        ----
            Performance: O(1) time complexity due to caching.
            Thread safety: Safe to call from multiple threads.
            Side effects: May perform health checks on dependencies.
