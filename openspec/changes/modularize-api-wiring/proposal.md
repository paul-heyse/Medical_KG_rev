## Why

The `create_app` function currently wires middleware, routers, docs pages, health checks, and a dozen exception handlers directly inside the factory. This creates a monolithic application setup that mixes infrastructure concerns with business logic and makes it difficult to understand how protocols integrate. The REST router repeats similar "fetch resource â†’ if missing return presenter.error" patterns across adapter endpoints, creating code duplication and tight coupling between HTTP handling and domain services.

## What Changes

- **Extract composable setup functions**: Break down `create_app` into focused setup functions for middleware registration, exception mapping, router inclusion, and health check configuration
- **Create protocol plugin registry**: Introduce a plugin registry that enumerates enabled protocols and supplies their routers/middleware, replacing hardcoded `include_router` calls
- **Introduce shared presenter helpers**: Create reusable presenter utilities (e.g., `presenter.not_found(code, title, detail)`) to centralize error handling patterns
- **Add query object abstraction**: Create `AdapterQueries` class to centralize resource fetching and error handling logic across adapter endpoints
- **Enable declarative registration**: Allow protocols to register themselves through configuration rather than hardcoded factory logic

## Impact

- **Affected specs**: `specs/gateway/spec.md` - API wiring and presentation layer requirements
- **Affected code**:
  - `src/Medical_KG_rev/gateway/app.py` - Refactor into composable setup functions and protocol registry
  - `src/Medical_KG_rev/gateway/rest/router.py` - Introduce shared presenter helpers and query objects
  - `src/Medical_KG_rev/gateway/` - Add protocol plugin registry and setup abstractions
- **Affected systems**: Multi-protocol API gateway, application bootstrapping, error handling, protocol integration
