      "text": "Maleic hydrazide (MH) inhibits corn root elongation through an effect on cell division apparently without inhibiting cell enlargement. The decrease in the rate of elongation was apparent only after a considerable lag, over 14 hours, even with a concentration as high as  $5\\mathrm{mM}$ . MH  $(1\\mathrm{mM})$  did not inhibit the growth of roots from corn seeds given very large doses of  $\\gamma$ -irradiation or excised corn root segments including the elongation zone or the cell enlargement induced by IAA in corn coleoptile sections. Many compounds including purines, pyrimidines, nucleosides, cysteine, pyridoxal, pyruvate, kinetin and  $\\mathrm{CoCl}_2$ , many of which had previously been reported to alleviate MH inhibition in other tissues, were tested for their ability to prevent the inhibition of corn root elongation by MH, but none were effective. These data do not support the theory that MH acts by inhibiting the synthesis of or competing with some simple metabolite or hormone. Whatever its mechanism of action the failure of MH to inhibit cell enlargement in most systems indicates that it is fairly selective.",

A variety of compounds including uracil (11),  $\\mathrm{CoCl}_2$ , cysteine (26), cystamine (20), pyruvate, pyridoxal (27), guanosine and thymine (14) have been shown to ameliorate the effects of MH on other systems. Most of these compounds were tested in concentrations equal to or greater than those used in the original investigations, but none is able to prevent the inhibitory action of MH on corn roots (Table 4). In addition to those shown in Table 4, a variety of other compounds such as thymidine, uridine, orotate, adenosine and thiamine were tested, but they too were unable to prevent the effect of MH. Most of these were also tested on pea seedling roots with essentially the same results, namely no preventative effect. Some, especially pyridoxal, markedly promoted root elongation in the absence of MH. Under some circumstances such as with adenosine (Table 4), this could be mistaken for a true \"reversal\" of the inhibitor. For gibberellin (10, 11), auxin (1, 19), kinetin (19) and several pyrimidines including uracil (13, 16, 23), tests on other plant tissues have already failed to produce any substantial reduction of the inhibition due to MH. So far, the data on corn roots do not support and, within the limitations imposed by the small number of molecules tested, even argue against the theory that MH inhibits the synthesis of or competes with any simple metabolite or hormone.",

It may be very significant that heterochromatic regions of chromosomes are affected preferentially (13, 18) and species with more heterochromatin do seem to be more sensitive (13, 18). Thus the primary effect of MH may be on the metabolism of the proteins or nucleic acids of chromatin. Although the action of MH on root growth resembles that of FU, the similarity may end with their ability to suppress cell division without inhibiting cell expansion. This notion is supported by the observation that the inhibitory effect of FU may be prevented at least partially by simultaneous application of thymidine but not thymine or uridine (Table 5) whereas the MH effect is not (Table 4).",

MH has been shown to cause defects in the phloem after exposures which are very long compared to those used here, but this is probably not the primary mean by which MH affects plant development. Certainly, the inhibition of cell division is not mediated through an effect on the phloem because it suppresses cell division in tissue cultures where a dependence on phloem transport is eliminated (23). Moreover, the failure of MH to inhibit the elongation of roots from  $\\gamma$ -irradiated seeds as it does unirradiated roots argues against the possibility that MH inhibits root elongation through an effect on phloem function. The drastic reduction in the amount of elongation in  $1\\mathrm{cm}$  root tips when they are excised (Table 1) indicates that the normal phloem function is still needed to supply nutrients from the seed. Since the same is true for roots from irradiated seeds, it follows then that MH does not interfere with phloem function during the growth of the roots in the  $\\gamma$ -irradiated seeds.",

      "text": "Although MH has long been suspected to inhibit plant growth mainly through an effect on cell division rather than cell enlargement, the evidence generally has not been clear cut. At least in the case of corn roots, MH inhibits cell division but not enlargement. Similarly IAA-induced growth in corn coleoptiles is not inhibited by MH. Since cell enlargement is known to require active metabolism including ATP and protein synthesis (see 2, 22), it follows that MH does not significantly interfere with these. Thus, MH appears to be relatively selective in its action.",
