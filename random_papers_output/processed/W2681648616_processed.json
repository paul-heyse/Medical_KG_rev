Presence of gliosis, immune infiltrate, and hemorrhage correlated with improved OS ( $p = 0.03$ ,  $p = 0.03$ ,  $p = 0.1$ ), while necrosis correlated with inferior OS ( $p = 0.01$ ). Improved OS was associated with gliosis in TN ( $p = 0.02$ ), and immune infiltrate ( $p = 0.001$ ) and hemorrhage ( $p = 0.07$ ) in HER2+. In a multivariable model for OS, incorporating these biomarkers with traditional clinical variables improved the model fit ( $p < 0.001$ ).",

      "text": "As systemic treatments prolong survival and, therefore, patients are living longer with metastatic disease, brain metastases are an increasingly common consequence of cancer [1]. A better understanding of the role of the microenvironment in primary breast cancer and its impact on prognosis is evolving. Tumor subtype has been shown to impact survival parameters, both in terms of time from primary diagnosis to the development of brain metastases  $(p < 0.01)$ , as well as overall survival following a diagnosis of brain metastases  $(p < 0.01)$  [2]. Graded prognostic assessments (GPAs) that incorporate breast cancer subtype, as well as clinical variables, such as age and performance status, have been found to hold prognostic value, thereby providing a valuable guide for clinical decision making in the management of patients with brain metastases [2].",

Features of this stromal landscape, i.e., high immune infiltrate and low or absent hemorrhage, offer prognostic value in brain metastases arising from melanoma [3]. Therefore, a more detailed understanding of the stroma surrounding breast cancer brain metastases may provide similar prognostic guidance, and perhaps reveal molecular underpinnings of this disease process yielding novel molecular targets for future therapeutic investigation.",

Survival by academic institution did not differ  $(p = 0.53)$ . The impact of biomarker expression on survival following craniotomy for brain metastases was analyzed. As seen in Fig. 4a, the presence of gliosis (score 1-3) was associated with superior overall survival (1.08 vs. 0.62 years,  $p = 0.027$ ). Similarly, Fig. 4b demonstrates that the presence of immune infiltrate (score 1-3) was associated with superior survival from craniotomy (1.31 vs. 0.93 years,  $p = 0.033$ ). The presence of hemorrhage (score 1-3) was not associated with a significant survival difference following craniotomy (1.07 vs. 0.92 years,  $p = 0.095$ ), demonstrated in Fig. 4c. While presence of necrosis (score 1-3 vs. 0) did not reveal differences in survival following craniotomy  $(p = 0.98)$ , Fig. 4d shows that the highest level of necrosis (score 3 vs. 0-2) was associated with inferior survival from craniotomy (0.38 vs. 1.12 years,  $p = 0.014$ ). The effect of each biomarker on survival from craniotomy was then examined across subtype. The prognostic impact of each biomarker and survival from craniotomy was maintained only for gliosis in patients with TN brain metastases (0.37 vs. 0.94 years,  $p = 0.02$ ), immune infiltrate in patients with  $\\mathrm{Her}2+$  brain metastases (1.12 vs. 2.06 years,  $p = 0.002$ ), and hemorrhage, though the trend for hemorrhage was not statistically significant (1.29 vs. 1.82 years,  $p = 0.07$ ), Fig. 5a-c.",

However, in contrast to the histologically based biomarkers examined by this study, the variables used in the trastuzumab model were clinically based (i.e., age, sites of distant metastasis) and illustrated low predictive value. A deeper investigation of the brain microenvironment's influence on other solid tumor brain metastases, such as melanoma, has informed prognostic capability [3]. For example, in the setting of brain metastases arising from melanoma, the presence of peritumoral immune infiltrate  $(\\mathrm{CD3+}$  and  $\\mathrm{CD8 + })$  and a low degree of hemorrhage is associated with favorable prognosis as defined by overall survival [3]. As this study shows that microenvironment features of breast cancer brain metastases also impact survival, harnessing this information may not only guide prognosis, but also reveal novel therapeutic strategies may be of benefit in breast cancer as well.",

Results from this study were complimentary to our findings in that overall survival following craniotomy correlated positively with expression of PDL-1 on tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILS, hazard ratio  $(\\mathrm{HR}) = 0.3$ ,  $p = 0.003$ ) in multivariable analysis that included clinical variables such as prior radiation therapy and HER2 expression.

To more accurately incorporate these data into current practice, this would require validation of these four histopathologic biomarkers in the context of prospective studies. The findings from such a study could result in an enhanced GPA that would aid clinical decision making for patients. Additionally, the focus of this study was solely on a limited number of histopathologic biomarkers found within the tumor stroma. A deeper look into the cellular communication within the brain microenvironment of breast cancer brain metastases, including interactions with microglia, neurons, astrocytes, and pericytes, is ongoing and remains an area of continued interest.
