## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Modular Biomedical Adapter Architecture

Biomedical adapters SHALL be organized into dedicated modules with shared infrastructure for common patterns and behaviors.

#### Scenario: Adapter Package Structure

- **GIVEN** the biomedical adapter ecosystem
- **WHEN** implementing new data source integrations
- **THEN** each adapter SHALL be contained in its own package
- **AND** share common infrastructure through mixins and base classes
- **AND** maintain consistent interfaces for metadata extraction and configuration

#### Scenario: Shared Infrastructure Utilization

- **WHEN** developing biomedical adapters
- **THEN** developers SHALL use shared mixins for common operations
- **AND** leverage standardized pagination, DOI normalization, and metadata extraction
- **AND** avoid code duplication across adapter implementations
- **AND** maintain consistent error handling and validation patterns

#### Scenario: Plugin Manager Integration

- **GIVEN** the modular adapter architecture
- **WHEN** registering adapters with the plugin system
- **THEN** each adapter package SHALL integrate seamlessly with the plugin manager
- **AND** provide standardized metadata and capability reporting
- **AND** support dynamic discovery and configuration loading

### Requirement: Standardized Adapter Interfaces

All biomedical adapters SHALL implement consistent interfaces for data fetching, parsing, and metadata extraction.

#### Scenario: Consistent Metadata Extraction

- **WHEN** adapters process biomedical data
- **THEN** they SHALL extract metadata using standardized interfaces
- **AND** provide consistent access to PDF URLs and open access information
- **AND** normalize identifiers (DOIs, PMCIDs, etc.) using shared utilities
- **AND** expose rich metadata through uniform data structures

#### Scenario: Adapter Capability Reporting

- **GIVEN** a biomedical adapter implementation
- **WHEN** registered with the plugin manager
- **THEN** it SHALL report its capabilities and supported data types
- **AND** declare supported identifier formats and metadata fields
- **AND** specify rate limiting and pagination requirements
- **AND** enable dynamic adapter selection based on data source characteristics

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Biomedical Data Integration

The system SHALL integrate biomedical data sources through a modular, reusable adapter architecture with shared infrastructure.

#### Scenario: Adapter Development and Maintenance

- **WHEN** adding new biomedical data sources
- **THEN** developers SHALL use the modular adapter structure
- **AND** leverage existing mixins for common functionality
- **AND** follow standardized interfaces for consistency
- **AND** integrate seamlessly with the plugin management system

#### Scenario: Code Reuse and Maintainability

- **GIVEN** the modular adapter architecture
- **WHEN** maintaining or extending adapter functionality
- **THEN** common patterns SHALL be implemented once in shared mixins
- **AND** individual adapters SHALL focus on source-specific logic
- **AND** changes to common functionality SHALL benefit all adapters
- **AND** reduce overall codebase complexity and maintenance burden
